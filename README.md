A guide for students new to creative computing and who are struggling to understand key concepts
</p>
When I was first reading brief for creative computing i felt very overwhelmed as it was completely new to me and is very different to anything 
I had done within graphics in the past. therefore I have created this handbook to inform others with easy step by step instructions.

  <strong>Liǎn (脸) </strong>
  is an experimental mask that explores the relationship between our online personas and offline self. It responds to one's real time online emotions.

  Liǎn is heavily inspired by the Chinese face changing opera art 变脸 (biàn liǎn) and online avatars. 变脸 translates to face changing. The performer changes their face to signify a shift in emotion. This performance parallels our online behaviours; we wear many faces online and are able to change them at any moment.
