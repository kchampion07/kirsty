# <strong>AN INTRODUCTION TO CREATIVE COMPUTING FOR BEGINNERS
A guide for students new to creative computing and who are struggling to understand key concepts
</p>
When I was first reading brief for creative computing i felt very overwhelmed as it was completely new to me and is very different to anything 
I had done within graphics in the past. therefore I have created this handbook to inform others with easy step by step instructions.

<strong> KEY TERMS 
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>readme.file</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  a readme.file is often the first document that a user will view. it is a file consisting of text that contains key information for the user about the software, project, code or game.
  it may include instructions or details about the patches and updates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>physical computing</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    physical commputing means interacting with real-world objects by programming them from a computer. some examples include an automatic doors and voice recognition. physical commuting is a huge part of our everday lives, it has huge creative potential.

  <strong>Liǎn (脸) </strong>
  is an experimental mask that explores the relationship between our online personas and offline self. It responds to one's real time online emotions.

  <br>
  Liǎn is heavily inspired by the Chinese face changing opera art 变脸 (biàn liǎn) and online avatars. 变脸 translates to face changing. The performer changes their face to signify a shift in emotion. This performance parallels our online behaviours; we wear many faces online and are able to change them at any moment.
