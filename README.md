# <strong>AN INTRODUCTION TO CREATIVE COMPUTING FOR BEGINNERS
A guide for students new to creative computing and who are struggling to understand key concepts
</p>
When I was first reading brief for creative computing i felt very overwhelmed as it was completely new to me and is very different to anything 
I had done within graphics in the past. therefore I have created this handbook to inform others with easy step by step instructions.

<strong> KEY TERMS 
  <br>
  ------------
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>readme.file</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  a readme.file is often the first document that a user will view. it is a file consisting of text that contains key information for the user about the software, project, code or game.
  it may include instructions or details about the patches and updates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>physical computing</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    physical computing means interacting with real-world objects by programming them from a computer. some examples include automatic doors and voice recognition. physical commuting is a huge part of our everday lives, it has huge creative potential.

  <strong>Liǎn (脸) </strong>
  is an experimental mask that explores the relationship between our online personas and offline self. It responds to one's real time online emotions.

  Liǎn is heavily inspired by the Chinese face changing opera art 变脸 (biàn liǎn) and online avatars. 变脸 translates to face changing. The performer changes their face to signify a shift in emotion. This performance parallels our online behaviours; we wear many faces online and are able to change them at any moment.

  <em>LED Sequential Control step-by-step<em/>
    <br>
    --------------------------------------
    <br>
    <br>
    You will need:
1 x Arduino Uno
    <br>
1 x Breadboard 
    <br>
1 x USB cable
    <br>
3 x 220 ohm resistors 
    <br>
4 x jumper wires
    <br>
3 x different coloured LEDs 
<br>
    <br>
   <em> step 1: <em/> 
     The first step centres around finding common ground. use a jumper wire to connect the Ground pin on the arduino to the negative rail on the breadboard. This allows all the LEDs to use the ground pin on the arduino.
     <br>
     <br>
     <em> step 2:<em/> 
       now insert the resistors onto the bread board making sure one leg is connected to the negative rail.
       <br>
       <br>
       <em> step 3: <em/> 
         inserting the LEDs. the longer of the two legs on the LED will be the positive one. connect the negative to the horizontal rail where the resistor is connected. connect the positive leg to an adjacent rail. Repeat for all three LEDs.
         <br>
         <br>
         <em> step 4: <em/> 
           to complete the circuit use three junmp wires to connect ports 13, 12 and 11. connect the positive LED on the right to output 13, the middle LED to 12 and the last to 11.
           <br>
           <br>
         <em> step 5: <em/> 
           to power on the arduino connect the USB to the computer
           <br>
           <br>
           <em>step 6:<em/>
             download the correct Arduino IDE in order for your system to work
             <br> 
             <br>
             <em>step 7: </em>
               press the upload button on the top left-hand corner of the screen to upload the programme.
<br>
               <br>
               the LED lights on your breadboard should now be on and working :)
